## Customer Data Analysis

### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer purchase behavior using a large e-commerce dataset. The analysis focuses on identifying key insights such as top customers, popular products, and yearly sales trends. The project uses Python with Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

#### Key Objectives

**1.Top Customers: Identify the top customers contributing the most to sales.**

**2.Popular Products: Highlight the products that are most frequently purchased.**

**3.Yearly Sales Trends: Analyze trends in sales over the years.**

#### Tools and Libraries

**Pandas: For data cleaning, aggregation, and manipulation.**

**Matplotlib: For visualizing trends and summaries.**

**Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization.**

#### Dataset

The dataset used is an e-commerce customer purchase dataset, containing information such as:

Customer ID,

Product Name,

**1.Data Loading: Import the dataset and review its structure.**

**2.Data Cleaning:**

**3.Handle missing values by dropping incomplete rows.**

**4.Convert the Purchase Date column to datetime format.**

**5.Add a calculated column Total Purchase.**

**6.Remove duplicate entries.**

**7.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

**8.Aggregate sales data by customer and product.**

**9.Extract yearly trends using the Year column derived from the Purchase Date.**

**10.Visualization:**

Bar plots for top customers and popular products,

Line plot for yearly sales trends,

Quantity Purchased,

Product Price,

Purchase Date.
##### Key Insights

**Top Customers**: Customers contributing the highest revenue were identified.

**Popular Products**: Products with the highest quantities sold were highlighted.

**Sales Trends**: Year-over-year sales showed a steady growth pattern.
##### Future Work

1. **Incorporate predictive analysis for forecasting future sales.**

2. **Analyze customer churn and develop retention strategies.**

3. **Implement segmentation to categorize customers based on purchase behavior.**
